# Random Turtle Movements
This is a Python Turtle project that uses the Turtle module to create a turtle object that moves in random directions and changes colors.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can download the project files from this GitHub repository.

Usage
To run the project, navigate to the directory where the project files are saved in your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

Copy code
python random_turtle_movements.py
This will run the Python script and open a window with the turtle moving in random directions and changing colors.

How It Works
The project uses the Turtle module to create a turtle object and define functions to generate a random angle, distance, and color. Then, a for loop is used to make the turtle move in random directions and change colors 100 times.
